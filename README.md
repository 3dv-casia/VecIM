# Vectorized Indoor Surface Reconstruction from 3D Point Cloud with Multistep 2D Optimization

This is the implementation of **VecIM** (ISPRS 2021), a multistep and versatile indoor LoD2 vectorized reconstruction pipeline without the Manhattan or Atlanta world assumptions. The core idea behind this method is the combination of a sequence of 2D segment or 
cell assembly problems defined as global optimizations while reducing the reconstruction complexity. For more details, please refer to the following [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271621001222):
