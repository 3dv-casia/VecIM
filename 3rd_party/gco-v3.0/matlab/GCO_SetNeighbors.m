function GCO_SetNeighbors(Handle,Weights)
% GCO_SetNeighbors   Set (weighted) pairwise connectivity of all sites.
%     GCO_SetNeighbors(Handle,Weights) determines which sites are neighbors
%     and thereby have a SmoothCost associated with them. Weights is a
%     sparse NumSites-by-NumSites matrix, where Weights(i,j) > 0 indicates 
%     that sites i and j are neighbors. If Weights is a 0-1 matrix, smooth
%     costs are spatially invariant. See SetSmoothCost for more.
%
%     SetNeighbors cannot be called after Expansion. 
%     Note: only the upper-triangular area of Weights is consulted 
%           because the connectivity is undirected.
